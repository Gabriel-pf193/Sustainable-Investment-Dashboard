# The Financial Impact of Sustainability: Do Green Companies Perform Better ?
**Category:** Data Analysis & Visualization

Over the past decades, environmental challenges, social inequality, and ethical governance have reshaped how our society defines progress. As a result, sustainability has become a central topic, not only in public policy, but also in the world of finance. Investors these days consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators a lot more, when evaluating the stability and ethical impact of a company. With this growing awareness, naturally we asks ouselves whether firms that embrace sustainability actually perform better financially than more traditional ones ? This project aims to explore this relationship by analyzing how ESG performance relates to financial performance. 

The main goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that compares financial indicators of performance of "green" companies with that of regular companies.
