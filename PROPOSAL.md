# The Financial Impact of Sustainability: Do Green Companies Perform Better ?
**Category:** Data Analysis & Visualization

Over the past decades, environmental challenges, social inequality, and ethical governance have reshaped how our society defines progress. As a result, sustainability has become a global concern, not only in public policy, but also in the world of finance. Investors these days consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators a lot more, when evaluating the stability and ethical impact of a company. With this growing awareness, naturally we asks ourselves whether firms that commit to sustainability actually perform better financially than more traditional ones ? This project aims to explore this relationship by analyzing how ESG performance relates to financial performance. 

The planned approach for this matter consists of collecting publicly available data on the ESG scores of a sample of companies via datasets such as Kaggle, as well as collecting financial data (historical stock prices, market cap, P/E ratio, dividend yield, etc.) of the same sample of companies using Yahoo Finance. Once the dataset is prepared (data is cleaned and matched for each company), I will use Python and its analytical tools to calculate key financial indiactors such as average returns and volatility.






The main goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that compares financial indicators of performance of "green" companies with that of regular companies.
